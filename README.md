<h1>Welcome to my Summer '23 Project</h1>

<hr>
<p>Upon completing my first year of engineering at the University of Guelph, I felt a strong desire to expand my skills and contribute to practical applications.  
At its core, the hand integrates microcontrollers, servos, transceiver modules, and flex sensors. The project can be divided into three main parts: the glove controller, the hand, and the base.

<h3>Here is a video to demonstrate what I was able to create</h3>
